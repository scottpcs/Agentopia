## Project Description

Agentopia is a React-based web application that provides a graphical user interface for organizing workflows involving multiple AI agents. It allows users to visually create, connect, and manage AI agent nodes in a flow-based interface. The project uses React Flow for the node-based interface and aims to support multi-agent conversations and sequential agent interactions of varying complexity.

Key features:
- Visual representation of AI agent workflows
- Ability to add and connect agent nodes
- Draggable nodes on the canvas
- Customizable instructions for each agent node
- Save and load functionality for workflows
- Workspace management for organizing workflows
- Cross-platform compatibility for file paths

## Current Implementation

The current implementation provides a functional proof of concept with the following features:
- A full-screen canvas for the workflow
- A toolbar for adding different types of nodes
- Draggable and connectable nodes
- Editable properties for agent nodes (OpenAI model settings)
- Save functionality that downloads workflows as JSON files
- Load functionality that allows users to open saved workflows
- Workspace management for logical organization of workflows
- Cross-platform path handling for consistent file naming

## Latest Code Structure

The main components of the application are:

1. App.jsx: The main component that orchestrates the entire application.
2. MenuBar.jsx: Handles the top menu bar with file operations and workspace management.
3. Toolbar.jsx: Provides buttons for adding different types of nodes to the workflow.
4. AgentNode.jsx: Represents an individual AI agent node with editable properties.
5. PropertyPanel.jsx: Allows editing of node properties in a side panel.
6. WorkspaceManager.jsx: Manages workspace selection and recent workspaces.

The application uses a download-based approach for saving workflows, compatible with browser environments.

## Recent Changes

- Implemented a more compact design for the AgentNode component.
- Updated the App.css file to include styles for a more streamlined UI.
- Adjusted font sizes throughout the application for better readability.
- Modified the toolbar width to be narrower (150px).
- Updated the PropertyPanel to use smaller font sizes and a more compact layout.
- Changed the menu dropdown styling to have a white background with dark, readable text.
- Implemented cross-platform path normalization for consistent file naming.
- Updated the user interface to reflect the current workspace and provide clearer instructions for file operations.

## Next Steps

1. Implement API Calls for Model Interactions:
   - Create a new node type for API calls to AI models (e.g., OpenAI's GPT models).
   - Implement a form within the node to configure API parameters (model, temperature, max tokens, etc.).
   - Add functionality to send requests to the API and display results.

2. Enhance Input/Output Handling:
   - Develop input nodes that allow users to enter text or upload files.
   - Create output nodes to display results from API calls or other operations.
   - Implement data flow between nodes, passing output from one node as input to another.

3. Improve Error Handling and User Feedback:
   - Implement more robust error handling for API calls and file operations.
   - Add a status bar or notification system to provide real-time feedback to users.

4. Expand Node Types:
   - Implement additional node types such as text processing, conditional logic, and data transformation.
   - Create a system for users to define custom node types.

5. Implement Workflow Execution:
   - Add functionality to execute the entire workflow, processing nodes in the correct order.
   - Implement a visual representation of workflow execution progress.

6. Enhance User Interface:
   - Continue to improve the styling and layout of nodes for better readability.
   - Add drag-and-drop functionality for easier node connection.
   - Implement zooming and panning controls for large workflows.

7. Add Authentication and User Management:
   - Implement user accounts to save and manage personal workspaces and workflows.
   - Add authentication to secure API calls and personal data.

8. Implement Collaborative Features:
   - Add real-time collaboration features to allow multiple users to work on the same workflow.
   - Implement version control for workflows.

9. Optimize Performance:
   - Implement lazy loading for large workflows.
   - Optimize rendering of complex node graphs.

10. Expand Documentation and Testing:
    - Create comprehensive documentation for users and developers.
    - Implement unit and integration tests to ensure reliability as the project grows.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application

## Dependencies

- React
- React Flow
- Vite (for build and development)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)

This summary reflects the current state of the Agentopia project and provides a roadmap for future development, with a focus on implementing API calls for model interactions in the next phase.
