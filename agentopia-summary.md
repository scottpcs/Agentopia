## Previous Next Key Work Focus Areas

Node Reference Clean-up (completed)
- Resolve issues where some node types are not being found, resulting in default node types
- Investigate and fix potential path-related issues

Enhanced Agent Builder: (advanced)
- Refine the node and agent palette functionality
- Develop a richer agent builder capability that includes behavior design

Multiple Agent Instances: (implemented, but needs cleanup)
- fix API issue with participant models. Need a way to access property panels for participants. Should probably be able to select model in the agent builder. Allow for auto-select but also user over-ride
- Enable support for multiple instances of a given agent in a single workflow
- Implement functionality for agents to interact in different contexts within the same workflow

Multi-Agent Conversations: (implemented but needs clean-up on API handling. Agents should have API already assigned)
- Develop a new node type or property setting to support multi-agent conversations

Conditional Workflow Control:
- Implement conditional conversation entrance and exit
- Add workflow branching capabilities

Context Management:
- Develop a robust system for managing and passing context between nodes and conversations

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Solution:
- Integrate a RAG system to enhance AI responses with relevant retrieved information

Improved Menu Bar Functionality:
- Enhance save and open operations
- Implement view change capabilities
- Add other useful workflow management features
