## Project Description

Agentopia is a React-based web application that provides a graphical user interface for organizing workflows involving multiple AI agents. It allows users to visually create, connect, and manage AI agent nodes in a flow-based interface. The project uses React Flow for the node-based interface and aims to support multi-agent conversations and sequential agent interactions of varying complexity.

Key features:
- Visual representation of AI agent workflows
- Ability to add and connect agent nodes
- Draggable nodes on the canvas
- Customizable instructions for each agent node
- Save and load functionality for workflows
- Workspace management for organizing workflows
- Cross-platform compatibility for file paths

## Current Implementation

The current implementation provides a functional proof of concept with the following features:
- A full-screen canvas for the workflow
- A toolbar for adding different types of nodes (Agent, TextInput, TextOutput)
- Draggable and connectable nodes
- Editable properties for agent nodes (OpenAI model settings)
- Save functionality that downloads workflows as JSON files
- Load functionality that allows users to open saved workflows
- Workspace management for logical organization of workflows
- Cross-platform path handling for consistent file naming
- Basic workflow execution logic (without actual API calls)
- Improved error handling and user feedback

## Latest Code Structure

The main components of the application are:

1. App.jsx: The main component that orchestrates the entire application.
2. MenuBar.jsx: Handles the top menu bar with file operations and workspace management.
3. Toolbar.jsx: Provides buttons for adding different types of nodes to the workflow.
4. AgentNode.jsx: Represents an individual AI agent node with editable properties.
5. TextInputNode.jsx: Represents a node for text input in the workflow.
6. TextOutputNode.jsx: Represents a node for displaying output in the workflow.
7. PropertyPanel.jsx: Allows editing of node properties in a side panel.
8. WorkspaceManager.jsx: Manages workspace selection and recent workspaces.
9. openaiService.js: Contains the logic for making API calls to OpenAI (currently a mock implementation).

The application uses a download-based approach for saving workflows, compatible with browser environments.

## Recent Changes

- Implemented TextInputNode and TextOutputNode components.
- Updated the App.jsx file to include new node types and implement a basic workflow execution system.
- Added an "Execute Workflow" button to the MenuBar component.
- Improved error handling and user feedback throughout the application.
- Reorganized and commented App.jsx and App.css for better maintainability.
- Added comprehensive headers to main files explaining their purpose and authorship.

## Next Steps

1. Implement Backend Server for API Calls:
   - Set up a Node.js server using Express or Fastify.
   - Create endpoints to handle OpenAI API calls securely.
   - Implement proper error handling and response formatting.
   - Set up CORS configuration to allow requests from the frontend.

2. Update Frontend to Use Backend API:
   - Modify the openaiService.js to make requests to the new backend endpoints instead of directly to OpenAI.
   - Update error handling in the frontend to deal with potential backend errors.

3. Enhance Workflow Execution:
   - Implement real-time updates during workflow execution.
   - Add the ability to pause, resume, or cancel a running workflow.
   - Implement error recovery mechanisms for failed node executions.

4. Improve User Interface:
   - Add a loading indicator during workflow execution.
   - Implement a more robust error display system.
   - Enhance the PropertyPanel with more intuitive controls for different node types.

5. Expand Node Types:
   - Implement additional node types such as conditional logic, data transformation, and API integration nodes.
   - Create a system for users to define custom node types.

6. Implement Authentication and User Management:
   - Add user accounts to save and manage personal workspaces and workflows.
   - Implement secure authentication to protect API access and personal data.

7. Add Collaborative Features:
   - Implement real-time collaboration for multiple users to work on the same workflow.
   - Add version control for workflows.

8. Optimize Performance:
   - Implement lazy loading for large workflows.
   - Optimize rendering of complex node graphs.

9. Enhance Testing and Documentation:
   - Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests.
   - Create detailed documentation for users and developers.

10. Prepare for Deployment:
    - Set up a production build process.
    - Configure deployment environments (staging, production).
    - Implement monitoring and logging for the backend server.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application

## Dependencies

- React
- React Flow
- Vite (for build and development)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)

This summary reflects the current state of the Agentopia project and provides a roadmap for future development, with a focus on implementing a backend server for secure API calls in the next phase.
