## Developer Guidelines

### Node Data Management
When developing nodes that accept user input, follow these principles:

1. **State Management**
   ```javascript
   // Always use both local state and node data
   const [localValue, setLocalValue] = useState(data?.inputText || '');

   // Sync with property panel changes
   useEffect(() => {
     if (data?.inputText !== undefined && data.inputText !== localValue) {
       setLocalValue(data.inputText);
     }
   }, [data.inputText, localValue]);
   ```

2. **Data Updates**
   - Use the node's ID from props, not from data object
   - Update both local state and node data when changes occur
   - Include comprehensive update metadata for debugging

3. **Property Panel Integration**
   - Ensure nodes respond to property panel changes
   - Maintain single source of truth for data
   - Use consistent data structure across all update paths

### Best Practices for Node Development

1. **Data Flow**
   - Always handle bi-directional updates
   - Implement proper event handling for user input
   - Add logging for key data changes
   - Consider all update sources (direct input, property panel, programmatic)

2. **State Synchronization**
   ```javascript
   const updateNodeData = (newValue) => {
     if (data?.onChange && id) {
       const updatedData = {
         ...data,
         inputText: newValue,
         text: newValue,
         value: newValue,
         lastOutput: newValue,
         input: newValue,
         output: newValue
       };
       data.onChange(id, updatedData);
     }
   };
   ```

3. **Event Handling**
   - Handle direct user input appropriately
   - Consider input completion events (blur, Enter key)
   - Maintain UI responsiveness during updates

4. **Debugging Support**
   - Add clear logging for state changes
   - Include source information in updates
   - Log both successful updates and failures

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Data Access**
   - Don't rely on data.id - use the id prop from React Flow
   - Don't assume all update paths trigger the same events
   - Don't skip state updates for performance unless profiling shows issues

2. **State Management**
   - Don't maintain multiple sources of truth
   - Don't update state without updating node data
   - Don't ignore property panel updates

3. **Event Handling**
   - Don't skip input validation
   - Don't forget to handle edge cases (empty input, invalid data)
   - Don't ignore input completion events
