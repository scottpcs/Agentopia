# Agentopia Project Summary

## Overview

Agentopia is an AI Workflow Proof of Concept application that enables users to create, manage, and execute complex workflows involving AI agents, human agents, and various types of nodes. The project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for designing and running AI-powered workflows, integrating seamlessly with OpenAI's API and supporting multi-agent interactions.

## Value Proposition

Agentopia empowers users to visually design and execute complex AI workflows that seamlessly integrate AI agents and human interactions in real-time, enabling efficient collaboration and automation without the need for extensive coding expertise.

## Current Implementation

The current implementation provides a functional proof of concept with the following features:

1. Visual Workflow Design:
   - Full-screen canvas for designing AI workflows
   - Draggable and connectable nodes for creating workflow logic
   - Support for AI agents, human agents, text input, text output, and human interaction nodes

2. Node Configuration:
   - Property Panel for detailed node configuration
   - Support for multiple OpenAI models including GPT-4, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and their variants
   - Customizable settings for temperature, max tokens, system instructions, and custom instructions

3. Workflow Management:
   - Save functionality that stores workflows on the server
   - Load functionality to open saved workflows
   - Download option for exporting workflows as JSON files

4. Execution:
   - Real-time workflow execution with actual API calls to OpenAI
   - Support for multi-agent interactions and data flow
   - Ability to stop and resume workflow execution
   - Dynamic updates to node properties during execution

5. User Interface:
   - Sidebar for adding different types of nodes and agents
   - Menu bar for accessing various functions (save, load, execute, stop, etc.)
   - Interactive panels for node configuration and interaction
   - Workspace management for organizing multiple workflows

6. Security:
   - Secure handling of API keys through backend storage with encryption
   - Credential manager for API key management

## Recent Improvements

1. API Key Handling:
   - Fixed issues with API key selection and passing to the backend
   - Updated PropertyPanel to use API key names instead of IDs

2. Workflow Execution:
   - Enhanced workflowExecutionEngine to handle different node types more effectively
   - Improved error handling and logging for better debugging

3. User Interface Enhancements:
   - Updated PropertyPanel to provide a more comprehensive set of options for different node types
   - Improved Sidebar functionality for better node and agent management

## Next Key Work Focus Areas

1. Node Reference Clean-up:
   - Resolve issues where some node types are not being found, resulting in default node types
   - Investigate and fix potential path-related issues

2. Enhanced Agent Builder:
   - Refine the node and agent palette functionality
   - Develop a richer agent builder capability that includes behavior design

3. Multiple Agent Instances:
   - Enable support for multiple instances of a given agent in a single workflow
   - Implement functionality for agents to interact in different contexts within the same workflow

4. Multi-Agent Conversations:
   - Develop a new node type or property setting to support multi-agent conversations

5. Conditional Workflow Control:
   - Implement conditional conversation entrance and exit
   - Add workflow branching capabilities

6. Context Management:
   - Develop a robust system for managing and passing context between nodes and conversations

7. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Solution:
   - Integrate a RAG system to enhance AI responses with relevant retrieved information

8. Improved Menu Bar Functionality:
   - Enhance save and open operations
   - Implement view change capabilities
   - Add other useful workflow management features

## Current Challenges and Considerations

- Ensuring consistency in node type handling across the application
- Balancing flexibility and simplicity in the agent builder interface
- Managing complex state and data flow in multi-agent conversations
- Implementing an intuitive system for conditional logic in workflows
- Developing a scalable and efficient context management system
- Integrating RAG capabilities without overwhelming the user interface
- Maintaining performance with increasingly complex workflows

## Technical Stack

- Frontend: React, Vite, React Flow, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- APIs: OpenAI

## Conclusion

Agentopia has made significant strides in creating a user-friendly platform for AI workflow design and execution. Recent improvements in API key handling and workflow execution have enhanced the application's reliability. As we move forward, the focus will be on implementing more advanced features like multi-agent support, conditional logic, and context management, while also addressing ongoing challenges to create a more robust, flexible, and powerful tool for AI-driven workflow management.
