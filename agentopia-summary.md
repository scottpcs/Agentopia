# Agentopia Project Summary

## Author: Scott Thielman prompting with Claude Sonnet 3.5
## Last Updated: September 23, 2024

## Project Description

Agentopia is a React-based web application that provides a graphical user interface for organizing workflows involving multiple AI agents. It allows users to visually create, connect, and manage AI agent nodes in a flow-based interface. The project uses React Flow for the node-based interface and integrates with the OpenAI API to support multi-agent conversations and sequential agent interactions of varying complexity.

## Current Implementation

The current implementation provides a functional proof of concept with the following features:
- A full-screen canvas for the workflow
- A toolbar for adding different types of nodes (Agent, TextInput, TextOutput)
- Draggable and connectable nodes
- Editable properties for agent nodes (OpenAI model settings)
- Save functionality that downloads workflows as JSON files
- Load functionality that allows users to open saved workflows
- Workspace management for logical organization of workflows
- Cross-platform path handling for consistent file naming
- Basic workflow execution logic with actual API calls to OpenAI
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Secure handling of API keys through backend storage

## Project Structure

The project is now organized into two main parts:
1. Frontend (React application)
2. Backend (Express.js server)

## Latest Code Changes

- Implemented secure API key handling through backend storage
- Updated the frontend to use key identifiers instead of actual API keys
- Improved error handling and user feedback for API key management
- Updated the project structure to separate frontend and backend concerns
- Implemented proper CORS configuration for secure communication between frontend and backend
- Updated the workflow execution process to use the backend for OpenAI API calls
- Improved the PropertyPanel component to handle different node types more efficiently
- Enhanced the TextInputNode and TextOutputNode components for better user experience

## Architectural Decisions

1. Separated frontend and backend for better scalability and maintainability
2. Used Vite as the build tool for faster development and optimized production builds
3. Implemented Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling approach
4. Utilized React Flow for the node-based interface to leverage its built-in functionality
5. Centralized API calls in the backend to enhance security and allow for future expansion
6. Implemented secure API key handling to protect user's sensitive information

## Next Steps

1. Enhance Workflow Execution:
   - Implement real-time updates during workflow execution
   - Add the ability to pause, resume, or cancel a running workflow
   - Implement error recovery mechanisms for failed node executions

2. Improve User Interface:
   - Add a loading indicator during workflow execution
   - Implement a more robust error display system
   - Enhance the PropertyPanel with more intuitive controls for different node types

3. Expand Node Types:
   - Implement additional node types such as conditional logic, data transformation, and API integration nodes
   - Create a system for users to define custom node types

4. Implement Authentication and User Management:
   - Add user accounts to save and manage personal workspaces and workflows
   - Implement secure authentication to protect API access and personal data

5. Add Collaborative Features:
   - Implement real-time collaboration for multiple users to work on the same workflow
   - Add version control for workflows

6. Optimize Performance:
   - Implement lazy loading for large workflows
   - Optimize rendering of complex node graphs

7. Enhance Testing and Documentation:
   - Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
   - Create detailed documentation for users and developers

8. Prepare for Deployment:
   - Set up a production build process
   - Configure deployment environments (staging, production)
   - Implement monitoring and logging for the backend server

9. Integrate Additional AI Models:
   - Add support for other AI providers (e.g., Anthropic, Google, Hugging Face)
   - Implement a plugin system for easy integration of new AI models

10. Implement Advanced Features:
    - Add support for file uploads and processing
    - Implement a system for handling structured data input/output
    - Create a visual debugger for workflows

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
npm install
cd frontend && npm install
cd ../backend && npm install
Copy3. Set up environment variables:
- Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory
- Add your OpenAI API key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
4. Start the application:
npm start
Copy
