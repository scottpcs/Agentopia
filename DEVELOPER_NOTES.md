We are structuring a key demonstration around a business workflow: building a team-based proposal. This will showcase Agentopia's ability to automate complex business workflows involving both AI and human agents. We'll explore multiple representations:

1. **Fully Automated Process (AI Only)**
2. **Process with Human Checkpoints**
3. **Mixed AI/Human Process Throughout**

## **1. Understanding the Proposal Preparation Workflow**

First, let's break down your existing workflow into discrete steps:

1. **Prospect Qualification**: Salesperson meets with the prospect to understand their needs.
2. **Initial Assessment**: Salesperson determines if the prospect's needs align with company services.
3. **Team Introduction**: Salesperson introduces prospect information to a team of directors.
4. **Information Gathering**: Team researches further and may request additional information.
5. **Project Plan Development**:
   - **Define Project Objectives**
   - **Outline Phases of Work**
   - **Specify Phase Objectives**
   - **List Phase Activities**
   - **Identify Phase Deliverables**
   - **State Assumptions**
   - **Estimate Phase Durations**
6. **Director Approval**: Each director reviews and approves their respective sections.
7. **Resource Estimation**: Estimate durations and resource commitments (e.g., FTEs).
8. **Proposal Assembly**: Salesperson compiles the information into a proposal document.
9. **Proposal Delivery**: The proposal is presented to the prospect.

### **C. Mixed AI/Human Process Throughout**

**Objective**: Showcase a collaborative approach where AI and humans work together continuously.

**Workflow Steps**:

1. **Initial Human Input**:
   - Salesperson inputs prospect data and initial notes.
   - Node: Text Input Node for data entry.

2. **AI Qualification Agent**:
   - AI provides an assessment and suggests questions for the salesperson to ask.
   - Node: AI Agent Node.

3. **Salesperson Conducts Follow-Up**:
   - Salesperson gathers additional information based on AI suggestions.
   - Node: Human Interaction Node.

4. **AI and Human Co-Creation of Project Plan**:
   - AI drafts each section of the project plan.
   - Directors collaboratively edit and refine their respective sections in real-time.
   - Nodes: Combination of AI Agent Nodes and Human Interaction Nodes linked together.

5. **AI-Assisted Resource Estimation**:
   - AI provides initial estimates.
   - Directors adjust estimates based on expertise.
   - Nodes: AI Agent Node followed by Human Interaction Nodes.

6. **Collaborative Proposal Assembly**:
